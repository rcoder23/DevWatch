# Error Tracking System

Welcome to the **Error Tracking System**! This project consists of three components designed to work together for tracking, saving, and displaying application logs and errors.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### 1. **ErrorTracker**  
   - **Description**: A dashboard that saves and displays logs and errors generated by applications.  
   - **Purpose**: Provides a central location to visualize errors, analyze logs, and monitor application behavior.
   - **Technology Stack**:
     - Backend: (e.g., Java, Spring Boot)  
     - Database: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)  
     - Frontend: (e.g., React, Angular, or other UI frameworks)   (TODO)
   - **Features**:
     - Save and display error logs.
     - Search and filter logs by type, timestamp, or severity.  (TODO)
     - Alert and notification integration (e.g., Slack, email).  (TODO)

### 2. **Error-SDK**  
   - **Description**: A lightweight Java SDK to integrate into other applications for capturing and reporting errors to the **ErrorTracker** dashboard.  
   - **Purpose**: Acts as a bridge between applications and the dashboard, ensuring all errors and logs are sent and processed.  
   - **Features**:
     - Capture uncaught exceptions.
     - Provide manual error logging:
       ```java
       ErrorSDK.captureException(new Exception("Sample error message"));
       ```
     - Attach context, breadcrumbs, and metadata for detailed error tracking.  
   - **Usage**:
     - Add the SDK jar to your application's dependencies.
     - Configure the `Error-SDK` settings (e.g., endpoint URL, app identifiers).

### 3. **Error-Module**  
   - **Description**: A test module that integrates the **Error-SDK** to simulate error generation.  
   - **Purpose**: Demonstrates how to use the SDK and generates test errors for validation.  
   - **Features**:
     - Includes sample code to trigger various types of errors (e.g., runtime exceptions, logging events).
     - Sends errors to the **ErrorTracker** dashboard for verification.
